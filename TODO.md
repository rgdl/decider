# TODO

- Make UI layout more visually pleasing
* what happens when the list is too long?
* what happens when the option text is too long?!
* results more vertically centered (split decider button into 2 distinct elements)

- make an icon (look at other icons to help decide, use app colour scheme)
- good simple README, to become app store description (look at competitors, make it similar but distinctive)
- animate transition between states (https://developer.android.com/training/animation/overview#transitions)
- don't forget to uncomment my real ad id before launch!
- add intent filters: https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing#intent
- animate option add/delete?
- make sure list of options and state (option entry vs results)is retained on screen rotate
