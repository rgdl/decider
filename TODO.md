# TODO

- good simple README, to become app store  description (look at competitors, make it similar but distinctive)
* check out analysis in jupyter notebook. Conclusions are:
    + categorise under productivity
    + look at the descriptions of the apps with categories other than entertainment
    + pick keywords to contrast with what's in the competitors' text (concatenate all fields to get this)
* SEO summary:
    + keywords
        > unique and accessible title, focused and not too long
        > use keywords that my competitors don't (do keywords here just refer to words that are in the description? sounds like other fields too)
        > the URL is important for keywords, and can't be changed later
        > developer name also keywords
    + title
        > "B: K" name format e.g. "Google Maps â€“ GPS Navigation"
        > Short brand name, then squeeze in keywords
    + description
        * both
            > Focus on USERS in the description, and what they'll get out of the app
            > Up to 5 repetitions of a keyword across the 2 descriptions
        * short
            > short description as long as possible
            > short description should be about values, not features, and include a call to action
            > emoji in short description
        * long
            > Keep most important text "above the fold", might not be possible until the listing has been created
            > html/emoji in long description
            > long description between 589 and 3385 characters
            > describe features in long description, bullet points are good
            > main description should contain all keywords (more than once OK, but not unnaturally repetitive). Best ones in first and last line
            > include a "call to action" with a sense of urgency
    + misc
        > Include screenshots
    + after launch
        > Consider localised versions for different languages
        > Monitor traffic, respond to issues in comments, update app to address issues
