# TODO

- user testing BUGS
    ✅ when adding an option, add to top or bottom? either way, scroll to make it visible
    ✅ keyboard seems to be in the way a lot, make it dismissable by clicking outside of any options
    ✅ results text looks misaligned for very short option text
    ✅ (T) when clicking in a field, indicate that it's possible to type (hide placeholder or previously entered text)
    * (T) exiting then clicking on the icon again clears the options
    * keyboard is pretty lousy in portrait mode. Disable?
