# TODO

- Make UI layout more visually pleasing, and devise a colour scheme, which will also go in the icon, is accessible and stands out from competitor apps
- make an icon (look at other icons to help decide, use app colour scheme)
- good simple README, to become app store description (look at competitors, make it similar but distinctive)
- animate transition between states (https://developer.android.com/training/animation/overview#transitions)
- don't forget to uncomment my real ad id before launch!
