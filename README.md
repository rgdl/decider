# Decider

Decision fatigue is a real problem!

In modern life, we're required to make constant, minor decisions (consider all different types of bread to choose between in the supermarket). These decisions all add up, occupying precious mental bandwidth that could otherwise be dedicated to things we actually care about.

If all options are equally good, why bother making a decision at all? This is where `Decider` comes in.

Just tell it how many options you're trying to decide between, hit the decide button, and it will randomly choose one for you.
