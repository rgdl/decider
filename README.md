Title:
"Decider: Brain Assistant"

Short Description:
"Stressed out by too many unimportant decisions? Let Decider make them for you!"

Long Description:
<p>ðŸ˜±Decision fatigueðŸ˜± is a real problem. However trivial, each decision we make uses up mental resources, leaving us less-equipped for the next decision.</p>
<p>Basic psychology tells us the brain can only process so much information at a time, so why waste mindful concentration on things that don't matter? Who cares what order household chores are done in?</p>
<p>Alternatively, leaving questions such as who pays for dinner to chance can be exciting ðŸ‘»</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>ðŸ§  Enter a list of options, then press <button>Decide</button> to see which one has been chosen for you</li>
<li>ðŸ§  To save time typing in options, create an empty list and they'll be named <strong>Option 1</strong>, <strong>Option 2</strong>, etc. (you can remember which is which!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let âœ¨Deciderâœ¨ be your Brain Assistant âœ¨ðŸ¤–âœ¨</p>
